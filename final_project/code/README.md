# final project code

The `src/` folder has all of the original python source files. The dependencies can be installed using anaconda with the given `environment.yml` file. The `data/` folder is where the source and working files go. The `output/` folder contains generated visualizations. This code was run in the conda environment on an aws ml.p2.xlarge instance, and will run slowly on desktop machines (especially without a graphics card).
